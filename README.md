# Generative-Adversarial-Bots

## What are Generative Adversarial Bots?
Briefly, Generative Adversarial Bots (GABs) are bots that are pitched up against each other, and generate a conversation that is used to train a third bot.

## Motivation
With the increasingly competitive environment of chatbots, many companies have to spend more money, time and energy on improving their technologies and research projects to match the level of competitors. To test them, developers need a massive amount of users to chat with their bots, so they can collect data and analyze it to decide on how to optimize their chatbot.

We wish to change that by proposing a novel approach to testing, evaluating and optimizing chatbots. The first part of the approach involves the application of currently available technologies, and massively utilize them. The second part involves the implementation of recent research papers into our Python code.

## Inspiration
One of the main paper that inspired our choice of project was Ian Goodfellow's paper on ["Generative Adversarial Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), also known as GANs. His work inspired many publications in Computer Vision and NLP, and inspired us by their use of generative and discriminative models.

Instead of using Neural Networks as models, we pair up chatbots and generate conversation until we deem it sufficient.
